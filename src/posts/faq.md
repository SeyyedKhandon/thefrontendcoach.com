# What did you learn from that tutorial you just watched?

It's something we are all quilty of, we watch a video, attend a lecture or read an article on a subject matter we wish to learn. We finsh reading or watching, and often we feel a small sense of acomplishment that we just learnt something, we close our laptop, or close our book and we carry on with our day under the assumption that we have effectively learnt something from this process. The truth is, learning is a **learned behaviour.** Whilst for a small, lucky, minority who have a gifted innate ability to easily absorb information really quickly and are also able to effectively retain said information. For the rest of us, that's not really the case. But it doesn't have to be that way. We **can** in fact become better at learning. Doing so could make all the difference on your code learning journey. It might not make you the next coding prodigy, but almost certainly will make you a better programmer.

## Start with honesty

Improving your ability to learn can only ever work if you're honest with yourself. I know, I know, it sounds a little cliche I hear ya. But think about it, if you're truly honest with yourself (and this doesn't always mean being highly critical) this will open up many doors that will inevitably lead to self improvement.

In the context of learning to code, this will become crucial not only as you learn to code initially, but also throughout your career as a developer. Your ability to learn, and learn well, will be incredibly important to you as a developer. From the perspective of a Front End Developer this couldn't be more true. The tech landscape on this side of the stack is forever changing, maturing and evolving. With new frameworks, libraries around the corner every month or so, at some point in time you will almost certainly be required to learn something new, be it for a business purpose at work, a side project, or even for a new client.

# Improve your learning process

Now you're totally cool with being honest with yourself. Whatever you're currently learning there is always an improvenment you can make to your processes (or lack thereof). For instance, lets say you want to teach yourself how to code with the end goal of becoming a Front End developer. Let us assume you have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of HTML and CSS but now you wish to learn JavaScript. You decide to follow some online tutorial course. The course (like many) is structured as a progressive learning experience, i.e. you start with the very basic foundational concepts of the language and gradually move on to more challenging, tricky aspects. Whilst you rattle through the course you are probably encouraged to build small, contrived projects as you go, and by the end of the course you may work toward building something a little more substantial with the focus beign to build in the concepts you have learnt during the course.

What often happens with this approach, is that you get some way through the course, maybe jsut past the foundational concepts (maybe not even that far) and you hit a road block. This usually occurs when one of two things happen:

* You start to explore more advanced concepts
* You try to build some application or small project of sorts

Sadly, a lot of people become disheartended, their progress stalls, they think they're not good enough, not smart enough to code and this significatnyl hampens their learning proccessm, they may even decide to give up entirely. Some onlookers may be thinking that's fine, this is just a way to whittle out those that aren't up to scratch and shouldn't be a developer in the first place. Well, in some cases that may be true, but in others, that will definitely **not** be the case. 

Most of these individuals will be self teaching, they may be working a full time job, have a family, and/or juggling lots of different things in their life at once. The solution for these individuals is multifaceted, it isn't just a 'one quick trick solution'. One particular facet of this solution will be improving their learning proces. Time management will be in their too. But in keeping with the main topic of this article, we will focus on the learning process. Here is a few things these individuals could do to improve their process:

### 1. Make some form of notes as you learn.

The notes you make could be hand written or they could be typed. They do not have to be extensive, and nor do they have to cover every nook and crany of a particular topic. If you decide to write some more elaborate detailed notes then great, but most of the time a short list of key point and takeaways will suffice. Also noting down what you did not understand can also be super useful, especially when you go back to reflect on these notes. They could be as brief as this for example:

* Variables in JavaScript consist of three main types
* `var` is less common. Over reliance on this could lead to unintended overrides and potentially buggy code.
* `let` and `const` are the modern alternatives 


``` javascript
  function getFullName (user) {
      const fullName = user.firstName + user.lastName;
      return fullName;
  }
```
