# Maximise your code-learning process by embracing frustration.
*January 2021* *-* *9 minute read*

***

With the availability of free online learning resources, it’s now ‘easier’ than ever to learn how to code. But is it really that easy? I can confidently tell you that it’s not. **Self-learning is extremely difficult**. That doesn’t mean I would advise against trying it. 

A self-directed learning process is inherently tough because you need to pick what you’re going to learn and what you’re going to learn from. A degree course or bootcamp handles this for you and so, it’s one less thing to worry about. The sheer quantity of learning materials and resources can become a blessi#ng as well as a curse. Because there’s no structured linear pathway set out for you, not only will you have to manage finding the best resources but you’ll also have to manage your progression or path to concepts and topics with increasing difficulty and complexity.

With a degree programme, difficulty usually progresses incrementally over time, in general, you’ll find more foundational concepts and topics covered within your first year, by the second and third years the workload and intensity of learning increases, many of the topics and concepts that you’ll learn will be more complex and often build upon things you learned at the beginning of your programme. I’m not suggesting that these learning programmes are the golden ticket for effective learning, but at a minimum, they do provide a structured pathway. 

This is ultimately why self-teaching is tough because you’re not forced by anything you’re going to have to guide yourself towards coding competency. You’re totally accountable for your own progression, and if you’re learning to code with the intention of landing yourself a job you’ll need to ensure you acquire the skills necessary to become an employable developer.

## The honeymoon phase

When you first embark on your code-learning journey there's a conflicting mix of discomfort and excitement. The excitement is often perpetuated by beginner-friendly courses and tutorials that hold your hand as they gently guide you through this strange new world. You’re exposed to new concepts, topics, and syntax in a safe and controlled environment. **This is a very support-intensive process that’s very easy to become dependent on**. The problem with hand-holding processes is that doesn’t last forever (at least they don’t if you want to progress). 

Tutorials and courses can’t do the work for you, that’s up to you. And so, before long the novelty and excitement that often accompanies starting something new gradually wears off and this tends to happen almost as soon as the hand-holding honeymoon phase ends. Once you begin to tackle concepts and topics that are more challenging, this is when progress begins to stall and motivation levels tail off.

## Learning is only worthwhile if it’s deliberate and focused

A lot of the reasons why learners give up after this honeymoon period isn’t because they don’t have the talent or capabilities to become a developer, it’s because of inefficient learning practices.

Learning for 99% of us is incredibly tough. We all learn in different ways, and this is true, but different ways do not necessarily mean ‘effective’. Most of our learning approaches are passive which limits our ability to progress. We’re in a constant battle with our brains. Our brains are naturally hard-wired to pursue the path of least resistance, to find the easier, most dopamine laden routes. It’s your greatest asset but can be your greatest enemy. Passive learning is an ideal middle ground that seems to appease both parties. It appeases you because you’ve made a deliberate effort to learn, to sink some time into something (your inner-voice is happy) whilst your brain is appeased because it doesn’t have to work too hard to structure any new knowledge or learning.

Let’s define what we mean by passive learning within a code-learning paradigm:

* Watching tutorials or courses
* Reading articles or books
* Code along exercises
* Learning stuff you already know 

These passive approaches might work for a seasoned developer but for beginners, these approaches are often very ineffective. You’ll find ‘practice’ thrown into the mix to counter passivity but it’s not quite as simple as that. What do we even mean by practice?

All practice is not the same. You’ve probably seen more experienced developers regurgitate the trite expression that “practice doesn't make perfect”. The problem is, it often doesn’t. Practice often follows a standard convention of mindless repetitions over content we already know or we’re already very familiar with. We do this because it makes us feel good, it makes us feel smart, it’s a dopamine trip for the brain. We end up mistaking these positive feelings for growth and progression. We often employ regular, repetitive practice as a means to mindlessly memorise content. Mindless repetition and memorisation cause problems because we fail to solidify our understanding of something. If you understand how and why something works it becomes much easier to structure that knowledge.

Enter deliberate practice. It has a huge amount of research and information behind it. Anders Ericsson coined the term while researching how people become experts. His [1993 academic publication](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f6f1/d52a73ace9361b0a16363bd5481ffa920c7b.pdf?_ga=2.262932492.168325746.1611672246-572063247.1611672246) has sparked much research and writing on the topic. James Clear has also written in great detail about this and I’d encourage you to read his [awesome introduction](https://jamesclear.com/beginners-guide-deliberate-practice) to the topic which contains some useful real-world examples. To surmise, deliberate practice differs from conventional or regular practice because it is:

* Purposeful
* Systematic 

In layman's terms, deliberate practice is basically **doing things that aren’t necessarily enjoyable**. Within a development context, there might be some variations in how we apply deliberate practice but In my opinion, It means figuring out what needs improvement and then focusing on improving that thing until you’re confident with it.

For instance, if you’re learning JavaScript and you’ve built a small todo app project (which naturally involves a fair amount of DOM manipulation) make sure you perform a retrospective on your project. Reflect on your understanding of the topics and concepts covered, Do you really understand the DOM? Identify any pain points, and areas you struggled with and actively work on them. You don’t have to apply this process to a project you can constrain this to a particular topic or concept – I’d actually encourage you to do that instead.

The hardest part of deliberate practice is the frustration and discomfort that comes with it. Ultimately, to be able to grow and improve in a meaningful way there has to be some experience of uncomfortability. This is all part and parcel of growth and we should expect to experience some degree of discomfort – you should welcome it. When you work on something that is outside of your current skill level this naturally comes with a fair amount of struggle.

## Dealing with the discomfort of frustration

Frustration and coding come hand in hand. Coding is a constant test of patience. Within a front-end development context, building a performant, accessible, and pleasant experience for users isn’t an easy feat. There are lots of moving pieces, lots of things you’ll need to consider as well as understand so naturally you’ll often encounter frustration.

Beginners treat frustration and discomfort as a sign of failure, they become stuck and often become disheartened and unhappy with their lack of progress. A common trait I’ve seen amongst successful developers that I’ve worked with as well (as successful students that I have mentored) is a **high tolerance to frustration**.

Ultimately, you must accept that frequent points of frustration are unavoidable in this profession. It all comes down to reframing the way you think about coding and how you channel as well as manage frustrations. The first step is to readjust your expectations of coding. It's totally normal to feel constantly frustrated. The second, but most important step is to see frustration not as the enemy but rather, as a necessary side-effect of growth. There are not many situations I can think of where growth in a particular domain or discipline is not accompanied by some level of discomfort or frustration. With this in mind, see frustration as something to continually seek out. Frustration is a fantastic marker for progress and a strong indication that you’re working outside of your comfort zone – all steps that are a necessity for growth. 

The learning process might feel like an exception but that’s merely because you’re not used to this intense learning process. Having the patience and resilience to methodically work through a complex debugging issue is an incredibly important skill, that’s why developers are paid good money!


## Final thoughts

There’s a lot to unpack here, and I feel like a lot of what I’ve touched on deserves some deeper introspection. I’ll leave you with what I feel are the most important takeaways.

### Practice can make perfect

Remember there are different forms of practice. Regular, highly repetitive practice is often an inefficient code-learning mechanism. Successful learners often employ a deliberate approach to practicing which is systematic and purposeful. An approach that intentionally seeks out discomfort.


### Build tolerance to frustration

Reframe the way you think about coding, it is a frustrating profession. Try to seek out frustration and discomfort because it’s one of the best markers for learning progression. If you’re frustrated there’s a good chance you’re reaching outside of your comfort zone. This is the sweet spot for learning.

In the end, there’s no one quick trick for achieving success (as with most things in life – coding included) but there are patterns and skills that do often differentiate the successful from the unsuccessful, and within a coding context the successful generally have a high tolerance to frustration and often engage in deliberate practice. What we’ve discussed doesn't necessarily just apply to newbie coders, improving your learning practices and reframing the way you see and experience frustration can help developers of all experience levels. 

**Enjoy coding and embrace frustration!**
