          <p class="u-mb--medium">I am a completely self-taught, front end developer. I don't have a computer science degree, nor have I ever paid for an expensive coding bootcamp. After finding myself at a crossroads in life, I decided on a whim to give coding 'a go'. Three years later, and I haven't looked back. In the past, I've worked as a strength and conditioning coach, a night-shift warehouse worker and I've also pulled pints behind a bar. I've taught myself everything I needed to know using a glorious little thing called the internet.</p>
          <p>After just under a year of intensive learning, I managed to bag my first job as a Junior Front End Developer. Now, I want to share my journey and help aspiring front end developers get their first jobs in the industry. Having reflected on what worked well for me (and what didn't), I want to use my work experiences and personal learning processes to help you acquire the skills <strong class="u-t--emphasis">you actually need</strong>.

            <p>I've been through the process myself. Learnning to code isn't easy, and it's certainly not easy teaching yourself. Knowing where to start, what resources to use, and what to learn can become a real headache, fast. Trying to sift your way through the never ending see of guides, tutorials, and blog posts can be off putting, and quite frankly, damn right confusing.</p>
            <p>I've launched this site and support system to give you my no BS, honest advice and support, helping you to learn only what <strong class="u-t--emphasis">you need to learn</strong> and in the most time efficient way possible, helping to give you every chance at kick-starting your career as a front end developer.</p>
