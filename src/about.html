          <p class="u-mb--medium">I am a completely self-taught, front end developer. I do not have a computer science degree, nor have I ever paid for an expensive bootcamp. Before becoming a developer, I've worked as a strength and conditioning coach, a night-shift warehouse worker and I've also pulled pints behind a bar. I've taught myself everything I needed to know using only a glorious little thing called the internet.
          After finding myself at crossroads in life, I decided on a whim to give coding 'a go'. Over three years later, I haven't looked back.</p>
          <p>After just under a year of intensive learning, I managed to bag my first job as a Junior Front End Developer. Now I want to share my journey - helping aspiring front end developers get their first jobs in the industry. Having reflected on what worked well for me (and what didn't), I want to use my own personal learning processes and my own experiences in a real job in tech to help you learn to code and acquire the skills you actually need to get a job.</p>

Knowing where to start, what resources to use and what to learn can become a real headache, fast. Trying to sift your way through the never ending see of guides, tutorials, and blog posts can be off putting and quite frankly, damn right confusing.</p>
